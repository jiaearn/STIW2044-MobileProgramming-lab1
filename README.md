This Flutter mobile application is a calculator that calculates the body shape index and estimates the risk of premature death based on the body shape index (ABSI). In this procedure, the user needs to provide some personal data in order to continue the program. The personal data that should be provided are gender, age, height, weight and waist circumference. Then, after the user enters the data, the program will calculate the ABSI and ABSI z scores and display the results of the risk of premature death.
